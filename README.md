# Cinema-Room-REST-Service

## About the project
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? <br/>
You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? <br/>
The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that!<br/>
Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, <br/>
and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!

## Learning outcomes
In this project, we will create a simple Spring REST service to manage a small movie theater. <br/>
It will handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services, and respond with JSON objects.
